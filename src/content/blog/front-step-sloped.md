Need to fix the slope to direct water away from the house.

**Current Issues:**

- Potential for foundation damage
- Safety hazard with slippery surface
- Mold/mildew growth possible

**Proposed Solution:**
- Re-grade the step to slope away from house
- Ensure proper drainage

**Priority:** High - Foundation water issues can cause serious damage if not addressed promptly.
