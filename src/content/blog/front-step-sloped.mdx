Need to fix the slope to direct water away from the house.

**Current Issues:**
- Water pooling against foundation (see video below)
- Potential for foundation damage
- Safety hazard with slippery surface
- Mold/mildew growth possible

**Proposed Solution:**
- Re-grade the step to slope away from house
- Ensure proper drainage
- May need to add drainage channel
- Consider non-slip surface treatment

**Priority:** High - Foundation water issues can cause serious damage if not addressed promptly.
