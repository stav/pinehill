Need to fix the slope to direct water away from the house.

**Current Issues:**

- Water pooling against the house (see video below)
- Potential for damage to the foundation
- Safety hazard with slippery surface in winter
- Mold/mildew growth possible

**Proposed Solution:**

- Tear out the current platform and steps
- Pour a new concrete slab and steps
- Ensure proper drainage away from the house

**Comment on the Solution:**

- The walk is in decent shape; but...
- There is concrete work to do at the street as the curb is crumbled, so...
- It might be just as easy to pour a new walk as well.
